# CDK Stack

CDK definition of the AWS stack

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Note
Before deploying make sure you run `npm install` in any lambda directory with a `package.json` such as `adminAuthorizer`
and `addVenue`

## Useful commands

- `yarn run build` compile typescript to JavaScript
- `yarn run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `yarn run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
